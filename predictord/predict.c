/*
 * This function determines whether it is necessary to begin compaction now in
 * order to avert exhaustion of any of the free lists.  Its basis is a simple
 * model in which the total free memory, f_T, is consumed at a constant rate,
 * R_T, i.e.
 *
 *	f_T(t) = R_T t + f_T(0)
 *
 * For any given order, o, members of subordinate lists constitute fragmented
 * free memory, f_f(o):  the blocks are notionally free but they are unavailable
 * for allocation.  The fragmented free memory is also assumed to behave
 * linearly and in the absence of compaction is given by
 *
 *	f_f(o, t) = R_f(o) t + f_f(o, 0)
 *
 * Compaction is assumed to proceed at a constant rate, R_c, that is independent
 * of order.
 *
 * It is assumed that all allocations will be made from contiguous memory
 * meaning that, under net memory pressure and with no change in fragmentation,
 * f_T will become equal to f_f and subsequent allocations will stall in either
 * direct compaction or reclaim.  Preemptive compaction will delay the onset of
 * exhaustion but, to be useful, must begin early enough and must proceed at a
 * sufficient rate.
 *
 * On each invocation, this function obtains estimates for the parameters
 * f_T(0), R_T, f_f(o, 0) and R_F(o).  It determines whether, if R_T and R_f(o)
 * remain constant and compaction begins at the next invocation, f_T(t) and
 * f_f(o, t) will intersect in the future at a point corresponding to a level of
 * free memory above some pre-defined limit that represents the lowest
 * achievable degree of fragmentation.  If this is the case then the function
 * indicates that compaction should begin now by returning a pointer to the same
 * structure passed in, now populated with parameters describing the anticipated
 * exhaustion.  The function returns NULL if no action is needed before the
 * start of the next time interval.
 *
 * Parameters f_T(0), R_T, f(o, 0), R_f(o) are determined by using the method of
 * least squares to fit a straight line to the most recently obtained data. R_c
 * is determined from [XXX: the vmstats already include a cumulative total for
 * the number of pages obtained;  augment them with the cumulative time spent in
 * compaction and recalculate a, presumably convergent, average each time here].
 * The threshold is [XXX: a very good starting point will be the value of f_f
 * after the completion of an entire compaction pass].
