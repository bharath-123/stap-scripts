Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] Introduce external fragmentation prediction to kswapd

Here is version 2 of my patch series. I made some changes to the prediction algorithm.
I used time as a threshold rather than pages. It seems to perform well,
Please do review it and test it when you have time. 
Rest of the code remains the same.

As systems age, memory begins to get fragmented. This fragmentation causes higher 
order allocations to fail. Even though there is enough memory to satisfy the allocation,
There is not enough contiguous memory to satisfy allocations. 
When there is not enough memory to satisfy allocations, the system goes into direct reclaim/compaction
which impacts performance. Reduction of these allocation stalls would immensely improve performance which 
happens to be the main goal of this patch series.

There have been efforts to reduce fragmentation. (i) Kcompactd is called after kswapd reclaims enough memory 
to balance the node. kswapd goes into a small sleep after balancing the node and then wakes up kcompactd.
(ii) More recently, watermark boosting as added by Mel Gorman. In this work, the watermarks of a zone
are boosted by a watermark_boost factor when an external fragmentation event is detected. Kswapd is 
then woken up explicitly(since the node could be balanced) to reclaim a small amount of memory and then 
it wakes up kcompactd to perform compaction.  
( I am not going back to the introduction of compaction, I am mostly talking about methods of
pre-emptive compaction).

This patch series aims to reduce fragmentation by modelling the trends of memory usage and 
memory fragmentation(i.e the trend in which memory gets fragmented by) and predict whether a 
potential external fragmentation event could occur based on these trends. We use the least square 
formulation to model these trends. More info is in the individual patch changelog and in the code
comments.

When kswapd decides whether it should sleep or not, we check if a potential external fragmentation
event could occur based on the above modelled trends. If a potential external fragmentation event
could occur, we do not allow kswapd to sleep which causes it to execute another run of balance_pgdat.
In this run of balance_pgdat, we call kcompactd to perform compaction.

This is pre-emptively compacting memory before any sort of fragmentation could occur.

We used Mel Gorman's mmtests workloads. We used the config-io-paralleldd-large-multi workload as 
it consistently put the system to direct reclaim. We used allocation stalls as the metric to test our
code. The patches were originally based of v5.1 but it easily applies to v5.2-rc? without any problems.

v5.1:
allocstall_dma 0
allocstall_dma32 0
allocstall_normal 1
allocstall_movable 321

v5.1-withpredictivememorypatch:
allocstall_dma 0
allocstall_dma32 0
allocstall_normal 0
allocstall_movable 10

These are fairly significant numbers. The amount of code added is also fairly less(A lot of code is comments).


Bharath Vedartham (4):
  mm: Add external fragmentation prediction logic
  mm: Add a new zone flag, ZONE_POTENTIAL_FRAG
  mm: Add external fragmenation prediction to kswapd
  mm: Unify watermark boosting and external fragmentation prediction
